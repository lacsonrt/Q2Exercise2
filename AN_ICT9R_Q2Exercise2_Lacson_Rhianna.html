		<br>
		<p id="Para1">The way the present cuts into history,<br>
		or how the future can look at first <br>
		like the past sweeping through, there<br>
		are blizzards, and there are blizzards.<br>
		Some contain us; some we carry<br>
		within us until they die, when we do.<br>
		The snow falls there, barely snowing,</p>

		<p style="font-family: Consolas;">into a long wooden trough where<br>
		the cattle feed on those apples we<br>
		used to call medieval, or I did,<br>
		for their smallish size, as if medieval<br>
		meant the world in miniature but<br> 
		not so different otherwise from <br>
		our own, just smaller, a bit sweeter,<br> 
		more prone therefore to rot quickly,</p>

		<p class="Para3">which is maybe not the worst thing.<br>
		Revelation is not disclosure. I love <br>
		how the snow, taking itself now more <br>
		seriously, makes the cattle look softer,<br>
		for a moment, than their hard bodies are.</p>
